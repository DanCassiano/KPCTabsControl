KPCTabsControl
==============

An non-auto-layout based multi-tab control designed to look and behave like the tab control in Apple's Numbers spreadsheet, with enhanced capabilities. Borrowed initially from the excellent [LITabControl](https://github.com/monyschuk/LITabControl)

The reason for not doing a fork, but a new lib? Well, I used the LITabControl since some time, and it diverged quite a lot. More importantly, I had troubles with AutoLayout, since my tabs are used inside a quite complex app, and AutoLayout is way too instable and hard to debug for such app.

The current status of the lib is: active dev, unstable.
